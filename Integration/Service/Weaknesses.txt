Distributed System Weaknesses:
Lock Contention: Multiple servers might attempt to acquire the same lock, which could cause delays in processing other requests.
Single Point of Failure: Relying on Redis or another external lock service introduces a single point of failure or a bottleneck if that service becomes unavailable.
Performance Overhead: Implementing a distributed lock adds some overhead, especially if many requests are coming in quickly.
Consistency Issues: In case of network partition or failure, lock acquisition might fail, leading to inconsistent behavior (e.g., two servers processing the same item).
